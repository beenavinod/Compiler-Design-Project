# Compiler-Design-Project

A Mini Compiler for the C++ programming language, focuses on generating optimized intermediate code and target code for the language for specific constructs.
It works for constructs such as conditional statements and loops
The main functionality of the project is to generate an optimized intermediate code and target code for the given C++ source code.

This is done using the following steps:
i) Generate symbol table after performing expression evaluation
ii) Generate Abstract Syntax Tree for the code
iii) Generate 3 address code followed by corresponding quadruples
iv) Perform Code Optimization
v) Generate Target Code.
